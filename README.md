# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains code for a car price prediction web application. The application utilizes two machine learning models - Linear Regression and Lasso Regression - to predict the selling price of a car based on various features. The application is built using Python, Flask for the web framework, and scikit-learn for the machine learning models.
